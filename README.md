# Food ordering API
This is a food ordering API, customers can view avaliable dishes and drinks, but must create an account before they can place an order or perform other searches through the end point. The code is well simplified and basic. open to modification. 
The signup process is designed to accept email only during signup not username
The pending update is to make the platform more flexible where different food vendors can signup to draw customers.
The Api is has different classes of users from customers to  staff to Admin, these offer some resrtrictions to what each class of user can and cannot do
